For immunization forecasting and supply planning to be effective, it must be proactive rather than reactive.

The assessment results are used to map countries into 3 phases: ad-hoc forecasting and supply planning, reactive forecasting and supply planning, and proactive forecasting and supply planning, with the last being the ideal. Routine monitoring of vaccines by countries ensures that countries maintain adequate stocks of vaccines, align demand for vaccines with supply, and minimize stockouts or the need to destroy vaccines due to expiries.")
